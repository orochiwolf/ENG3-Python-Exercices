Exercise: List Statistics
Objective
Implement three functions to calculate list statistics:
Functions

    length(lst): Returns the number of elements.
    mean(lst): Calculates the arithmetic mean.
    range_of_list(lst): Returns the difference between max and min values.

Instructions

    Write each function with clear documentation.
    Handle edge cases (e.g., empty list).
    Test functions with sample lists.

Requirements

    Correct calculation logic.
    Error handling for non-numeric values.
    Readable code.

Example Usage
Python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(length(numbers))  # Output: 5
print(mean(numbers))    # Output: 3.0
print(range_of_list(numbers))  # Output: 4

Grading Criteria

    Functional correctness.
    Error handling.
    Code organization and readability.

Bonus

    Calculate median.
    Implement standard deviation.
    Create a dictionary with list statistics.
    Handle non-list inputs.

Test Cases

    Empty list.
    List with single element.
    List with negative numbers.
    List with floating-point numbers.
